## Overview

EchoSpot is a little web application that harnesses the power of the Echonest API to help you find new cool artists, playlists and songs. Technically the app can be used on its own for casual browsing, but its real power comes when hooked back into Spotify. Any artist or song has a simple link that auto links back to the Spotify app. Also, when combined with csv parser tools, you can import playlists generated here back into Spotify as well.

EchoSpot has full mobile integration for on the go as well. Just open this site on a mobile device for a completely different, jQuery Mobile based experience. Clicks on spotify links here auto link into the Spotify mobile app.
