## Overview

EchoNest is a self contained, jQuery Mobile based app split into two areas for now: Top and Browse. Top lists the top 40 'hottest' Echonest artists, based on current music trends, internet buzz and other factors. Browse allows for filtering by year, style, mood, description and more to find artists.

Be it through the top artists section the or the results of a browse, from any list of artists one can jump immediately to that artist on Spotify, learn descriptive terms that best describe the artist in question (to eventually be fed back into a browse filter for more discovery) and find related artists.

The general goal is to find a starting point list of artists, and keep on searching deeper and deeper, discovering more along the way.

It's in very buggy, early stages, but is a framework that's hopefully accessible and adapable from any mobile device or your standard web browser.
