## Overview

EchoSpot is a little web application that harnesses the power of the Echonest API to help you find new cool artists, playlists and songs. Technically the app can be used on its own for casual browsing, but its real power comes when hooked back into Spotify. Copy generated playlists to your clipboard with a single click and import then directly into the desktop Spotify client. In addition, all listed artists and songs have a simple direct link back to the Spotify app. 

EchoSpot has full mobile integration for on the go as well. Just open this site on a mobile device; the app is fully responsive. Clicks on Spotify links in a mobile context auto link and open the Spotify mobile app.
