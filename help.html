		<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

		<p>EchoSpot is a little web application that harnesses the power of the Echonest API to help you find new cool artists, playlists and songs. Technically the app can be used on its own for casual browsing, but its real power comes when hooked back into Spotify. Copy generated playlists to your clipboard with two clicks and import then directly into the desktop Spotify client. In addition, all listed artists and songs have a simple link back to the Spotify app.</p>

		<p>EchoSpot has full mobile integration for on the go as well. Just open this site on a mobile device; the site layout is responsive. Clicks on spotify links here auto link into the Spotify mobile app. Note with touch there are a few small functional changes: taps on artist rows are treated the same as mouse hovers (more Spotify and Echonest related information is revealed). Taps on song rows auto open the song in Spotify.</p>

		<h3 id="desc">Song and Artist Details</h3>

		<p>After any search you'll get rows of results. An artist row has several references that appear on mouseover:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spotify link:</strong> Click here to open up the artist in Spotify.</li>
			<li><strong>Hotness:</strong> The relative "hotness" of this artist on a percentage scale as determined by Echonest. Buzzworthy, talked
				about artists tend to hover above 60%.</li>
			<li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> Artist familiarity on a percentage scale.</li>
			<li><strong>Terms:</strong> Click here to get terms or definitions related to this artist. On the list that appears you can click on any
				term to jump back to the 'search artists' screen and prefill with the descriptive term in question.</li>
			<li><strong>Related Artists:</strong> Click here to get a list of related artists to explore further.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Song rows have their own information:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spotify link:</strong> Click here to open up the song in Spotify. In most cases, the song will autoplay immediately.</li>
			<li><strong>sh:</strong> Song hotness, a percentage rating as defined by Echonest.</li>
			<li><strong>ah:</strong> Artist hotness (Echonest percentage)</li>
			<li><strong>af:</strong> Artist familiarity (Echonest percentage)</li>
			<li><strong>d:</strong> Danceability (Echonest perentage, <a href="http://runningwithdata.com/post/1321504427/danceability-and-energy">learn more</a>)</li>
			<li><strong>e:</strong> Energy (Echonest percentage, <a href="http://runningwithdata.com/post/1321504427/danceability-and-energy">Learn more</a>)</li>
			<li><strong>t:</strong> Tempo or speed of the song, measured in beats per minute (bpm)</li>
		</ul>


		<h3 id="playlist">Generating playlists</h3>

		<p>There are four types of static playlists Echonest can generate: artist radio, artist description, specific artists, and song radio. Select between
			these with the <em>Playlist Type</em> dropdown. Artist radio requires anywhere from one to five artists entered (under <em>Artist(s)/Spotify URI(s)</em>) as the base to generate a playlist of both these artists and related artists. A single artist can be a name description (e.g. 'Daft Punk') or a Spotify artist URI (format 'spotify:artist:XXXXXXXXX'). Specific artists is like artist radio, but it restricts 
			the playlist naturally to just those artists. Song radio requires anywhere from one to five Spotify URIs (of the format 'spotify:track:XXXXXXX' in the <em>Artist(s)/Spotify URI(s)</em> field). Artist description requires anywhere from 1-5 terms, separated by commas (e.g. 80s, cold, funk)
			in the <em>Descriptive terms</em> field, and generates a playlist based on those terms.</p>

		<p>So while every playlist requires either the <em>Artist(s)/Spotify URI(s)</em> or <em>Descriptive terms</em> fields filled there's a lot
			of other options to limit what comes back. Take a look at the <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/playlist.html#static">Echonest documentation</a> playlist for all the details.</p>

		<p>As clarification: song hotness, energy, and danceability can be set to 'high', 'average' and 'low', or combinations of that (e.g. 'high + average'). High refers to a rating above 0.7, average between 0.3 and 0.7 while low refers to ratings below 0.3. Artist familiarity
			can be set to 'familiar', 'average' and 'obscure' or combinations of. Familiar has a rating above 0.7, average to between 0.3 and 0.7 and low below 0.3. Finally, artist variety can be set to 'very high', 'high', 'average' and 'low'. Very high sets variety to 1, the highest setting. High sets it to 0.6, average is the default setting of 0.3, and low sets it to 0.1.</p>

		<h3 id="artist">Finding artists</h3>

		<p>Search for artists in two ways: either directly enter a single artist name (e.g. 'Daft Punk') in the <em>Artist(s)/Spotify URI(s)</em> field, or 
		enter a term or series of terms (e.g. 'rock') separated by commas in the <em>Descriptive terms</em> field. Don't enter something in both fields
		or you will get an error. Though it generally isn't as successful here, you can also use the other filters
		to cut your search down further.</p>

		<h3 id="song">Finding songs</h3>

		<p>Search for songs in three ways: Enter in a single artist name (e.g. 'Daft Punk') in the <em>Artist(s)/Spotify URI(s)</em> field to get a series of songs by that artist. Alternatively, enter a song name (e.g. 'title') to hone in a single song title. Finally, you can also enter a combined artist and song name (e.g. 'radiohead karma police') to try and find a song more easily. Again, like with artists, you can use the other filters to cut down the final response, but again you may get mixed results.</p>

		<h3 id="top">Top artists</h3>

		<p>At any time to get a quick reference of the top 40 hottest, buzzworthy artists according to Echonest, just click on Top artists at the top
			nav.</p>
			
			
		<h3 id="export">Export playlists to Spotify</h3>

		<p>It's really easy to export a playlist of data into Spotify. A 'Playlist' option appears in the navigation after generating any playlist; just click on it. You'll be taken to a screen with a big text area of spotify links and a copy to clipboard button. If you're running Flash, one click on the button will copy the Spotify playlist to your clipboard. If you're not running Flash, select all the contents in the text area and manually copy. With the Spotify playlist contents in your clipboard, just switch to the desktop Spotify client, select or create any playlist and directly paste (Edit > Paste or Cmd+V) the tracks in.</p>

		<h3 id="download">Download a CSV</h3>

		<p>After generating any playlist, an additional 'CSV' option should appear. This appears as a reference to the right
			of Help in the navigation. If you've got a device that can support it you'll automatically download a csv file of the current results on screen.</p>
